tumblr-crawler
===============

##My changes:

This version names files as <tags>_<postID>_<originalFilename>.jpg as they are downloaded.

Also I made it generate json for each post by default in this version. I like to have a folder full of searchable metadata about the files.

Also it's single-threaded by default because Tumblr kept locking me out.

This is a [Python](https://www.python.org) script that you can easily download
all the photos and videos from your favorite tumblr blogs.

## Prerequisite

#### For Programmers and Developers

You know how to install `Python` and `pip`. Then `pip install requests xmltodict`

or

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dixudx/tumblr-crawler.git
$ cd tumblr-crawler
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### For non-programmers


* Installing Python: refer to [this guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/)

* Installing pip: refer to [installation guide](https://pip.readthedocs.org/en/stable/installing/#install-pip)

* Run `pip install xmltodict six "requests>=2.10.0" "PySocks>=1.5.6"` in your terminal ([Windows terminal](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/open-a-command-prompt-window),
[Mac OS terminal](http://www.howtogeek.com/210147/how-to-open-terminal-in-the-current-os-x-finder-location/))

## Configuration and Downloading

There are 2 ways to specify the sites you want to download, either by creating a sites.txt file or specifying in the command line parameter.

### Use sites.txt

Find a text editor and open the file `sites.txt`, add the sites you want to download into the file, separated by comma/space/tab/CR, no `.tumblr.com` suffixes. For example, if you want to download _vogue.tumblr.com_ and _gucci.tumblr.com_, compose the file like this:

```
vogue,gucci
vogue2, gucci2
```

And then save the file, and run `python tumblr-photo-video-ripper.py`
in your terminal or just **double click the file** which will be automatically run by Python.

### Use the command line parameter (only for OS experts)

If you are familiar with command lines in Windows or Unix systems, you may run the script with a parameter to specify the sites:

```bash
python tumblr-photo-video-ripper.py site1,site2
```

The site names should be separated with comma, no space and no `.tumblr.com` suffixes needed.

### How the files get downloaded and stored

The photos/videos will be saved to the folders named with the tumblr blog.
You will find them in the current path/directory.

This script will **not re-download** the photos or videos
if they have already been downloaded. So it will **do no harm** by running this
script several times. In the meanwhile, you can find back the **missing** photos
or videos.


### Use Proxies (Optional)

You may want to use proxies when downloading. Please refer to `./proxies_sample1.json` and `./proxies_sample2.json`.
And save your own proxies to `./proxies.json` in json format.
You can validate the content by visiting <http://jsonlint.com/>.

If `./proxies.json` is an empty file, no proxies will be used during downloading.

If you are using Shadowsocks with global mode, your `./proxies.json` can be,

```json
{
    "http": "socks5://127.0.0.1:1080",
    "https": "socks5://127.0.0.1:1080"
}
```

And now you can enjoy your downloads.


### More customizations for Programmers Only

```
# Setting timeout
TIMEOUT = 10

# Retry times
RETRY = 5

# Medium Index Number that Starts from
START = 0

# Numbers of photos/videos per page
MEDIA_NUM = 50

# Numbers of downloading threads concurrently
THREADS = 10
```

You can set `TIMEOUT` to another value, e.g. 50, according to
your network quality.

And this script will retry downloading the images or videos several
times (default value is 5).

You can also only download photos or videos by commenting

```python
def download_media(self, site):
    # only download photos
    self.download_photos(site)
    #self.download_videos(site)
```

or

```python
def download_media(self, site):
    # only download videos
    #self.download_photos(site)
    self.download_videos(site)
```
